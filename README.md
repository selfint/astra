Rust web application framework.

In contrast to other Rust web frameworks, this framework compiles code
to plain javascript (more like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)).

It will use the same reactivity model of [SolidJs](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_signals).

This project is meant as a learning exercise for me, on how web frameworks work.
